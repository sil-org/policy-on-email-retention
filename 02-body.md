## Email Data Retention Policy

### SIL Global

**Version:** 1.0 **Effective Date:** August 7,2025 **Last Reviewed:** [Date of Last Review - e.g., August 7,2025]

---

**1. Policy Statement**

SIL Global (hereinafter "the Organization") recognizes email as a vital communication tool and a potential repository of valuable organizational information. This Email Data Retention Policy establishes guidelines for the retention and disposal of email communications to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory obligations, mitigate risks, optimize storage, and support operational efficiency while preserving essential institutional knowledge.

**2. Purpose**

The purpose of this policy is to:

- Define a clear, consistent, and justifiable retention period for email communications.
    
- Ensure compliance with relevant legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations.
    
- Reduce the volume of stored email data, thereby lowering storage costs and improving system performance.
    
- Minimize the risk associated with retaining unnecessary or outdated information.
    
- Support efficient information retrieval when legitimate needs arise (e.g., audits, legal discovery).
    
- Protect the privacy and personal data of individuals as required by law.
    

**3. Scope**

This policy applies to all email communications sent, received, or stored on the Organization's email systems, including, but not limited to, official organizational email accounts, shared mailboxes, and email archived by the Organization. This policy applies to all staff, volunteers, contractors, and any third parties who use the Organization's email systems.

**4. Guiding Principles**

- **Necessity:** Retain email data only for as long as it is necessary for business, legal, or historical purposes.
    
- **Compliance:** Adhere to all applicable laws and regulations concerning data retention (e.g., donor privacy laws, financial record-keeping requirements).
    
- **Efficiency:** Streamline email management processes to reduce administrative burden and storage overhead.
    
- **Security:** Ensure that email data, whether active or archived, is protected from unauthorized access, loss, or disclosure.
    
- **Accountability:** Establish clear responsibilities for email management and retention.
    

**5. Retention Period**

**The standard retention period for all email communications within SIL Global's email system is three (3) years from the date of creation or receipt.**

Upon the expiration of this three-year period, emails will be automatically or manually deleted from active mailboxes and archives unless subject to an exception outlined in Section 6.

**6. Exceptions to the 3-Year Retention Period**

Certain email communications may require a retention period different from the standard three years due to legal, regulatory, operational, or historical requirements. These exceptions are:

- **Longer Retention Required by Law or Regulation:** Emails containing information that is subject to specific legal or regulatory retention periods (e.g., financial records, grant documentation, HR records, legal correspondence) must be retained for the period mandated by those requirements. Such emails should be identified and migrated to appropriate record-keeping systems (e.g., document management system, HR system, financial system) and managed according to the retention schedule for those specific record types.
    
    - _Examples:_ Donor agreements, grant applications and reports, contracts, financial transaction confirmations.
        
- **Shorter Retention for Non-Essential Communications:** Emails identified as purely transitory or ephemeral in nature, with no long-term business value (e.g., daily internal meeting reminders, short-term project coordination that is documented elsewhere), may be deleted sooner, provided they do not contain any information required for legal, regulatory, or operational purposes. Users are encouraged to delete such emails promptly.
    
- **Legal Hold/Litigation Hold:** If the Organization is involved in or anticipates litigation, an audit, or an investigation, a "legal hold" or "litigation hold" may be issued. Upon receiving a legal hold notification, all relevant email communications, regardless of their standard retention period, **must be preserved indefinitely** until the legal hold is formally lifted by the Legal Counsel or Executive Director. It is the immediate responsibility of all staff named in a legal hold to preserve all specified emails and not delete them.
    
- **Historical or Archival Value:** Emails identified as having significant historical or archival value to the Organization's mission, history, or long-term operational understanding may be permanently archived. Such decisions must be formally approved by the Data Governance Council or Executive Director. These emails should be moved to a designated archival system, not retained in active mailboxes.
    
    - _Examples:_ Strategic planning discussions, founding documents, significant policy decisions, major campaign launches.
        
- **Employee Departure:** Upon the departure of an employee, their email account will be subject to the standard 3-year retention policy for historical emails. However, active access will be immediately terminated. Critical business-related emails of departing employees may be transferred to their supervisor or a designated successor for continued operational needs, but subject to the overall retention policy.
    

**7. Implementation and Responsibilities**

- **IT Department:**
    
    - Responsible for configuring and managing the email system to enforce the 3-year retention period and any approved exceptions.

    - Ensuring the secure disposal of email data at the end of its retention period.
        
    - Providing guidance and tools for identifying and managing emails subject to exceptions.
        
- **All Staff and Volunteers:**
    
    - Understand and adhere to this policy.
        
    - Proactively manage their mailboxes by deleting non-essential emails more frequently than the 3-year period.
        
    - Identify and properly flag or transfer emails that fall under the exceptions (e.g., financial records, legal documents) to appropriate record-keeping systems.
        
    - Immediately comply with any legal hold notification and preserve all relevant emails.
        
    - Exercise good judgment in determining what constitutes a business record that should be retained versus ephemeral communication.
        
- **Data Owners/Department Heads:**
    
    - Work with the IT Department and Data Governance Council to identify emails within their domain that fall under exceptions requiring longer or shorter retention.
        
    - Ensure their teams understand and comply with this policy.
        
- **Data Governance Council:**
    
    - Oversee the implementation and effectiveness of this policy.

    - Periodically review this policy to ensure its alignment with legal, regulatory, and organizational requirements.
        

**8. Data Disposal**

At the end of their retention period, emails will be securely deleted and rendered unrecoverable from all organizational systems, including backups, to the extent technically feasible and legally permissible.

**9. Training and Awareness**

All staff and volunteers will receive training on this Email Data Retention Policy during onboarding and periodically thereafter. The training will cover the policy's purpose, the 3-year retention period, exceptions, and individual responsibilities.

**10. Policy Review and Compliance**

This policy will be reviewed by the Data Governance Council at least annually, or as needed, to ensure its continued relevance, effectiveness, and compliance with evolving legal, regulatory, and operational requirements.

Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or volunteer service, and potential legal consequences for the Organization.
