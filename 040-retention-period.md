# Retention Period

**The standard retention period for all email communications within SIL Global's email system is three (3) years from the date of creation or receipt.**

Upon the expiration of this three-year period, emails will be automatically or manually deleted from active mailboxes and archives unless subject to an exception outlined below.

## Exceptions to the 3-Year Retention Period

Certain email communications may require a retention period different from the standard three years due to legal, regulatory, operational, or historical requirements. These exceptions are:

- **Longer Retention Required by Law or Regulation:** Emails containing information that is subject to specific legal or regulatory retention periods (e.g., financial records, grant documentation, HR records, legal correspondence) must be retained for the period mandated by those requirements. Such emails should be identified and migrated to appropriate record-keeping systems (e.g., document management system, HR system, financial system) and managed according to the retention schedule for those specific record types.
    
    - _Examples:_ Donor agreements, grant applications and reports, contracts, financial transaction confirmations.
        
- **Shorter Retention for Non-Essential Communications:** Emails identified as purely transitory or ephemeral in nature, with no long-term business value (e.g., daily internal meeting reminders, short-term project coordination that is documented elsewhere), may be deleted sooner, provided they do not contain any information required for legal, regulatory, or operational purposes. Users are encouraged to delete such emails promptly.
    
- **Legal Hold/Litigation Hold:** If SIL Global is involved in or anticipates litigation, an audit, or an investigation, a "legal hold" or "litigation hold" may be issued. Upon receiving a legal hold notification, all relevant email communications, regardless of their standard retention period, **must be preserved indefinitely** until the legal hold is formally lifted by the Legal Counsel or Executive Director. It is the immediate responsibility of all staff named in a legal hold to preserve all specified emails and not delete them.
    
- **Historical or Archival Value:** Emails identified as having significant historical or archival value to SIL Global's mission, history, or long-term operational understanding may be permanently archived. Such decisions must be formally approved by the Data Governance Council or Executive Director. These emails should be moved to a designated archival system, not retained in active mailboxes.
    
    - _Examples:_ Strategic planning discussions, founding documents, significant policy decisions, major campaign launches.
        
- **Employee Departure:** Upon the departure of an employee, their email account will be subject to a 6-month retention policy for historical emails. However, active access will be immediately terminated. Critical business-related emails of departing employees may be transferred to their supervisor or a designated successor for continued operational needs, but subject to the overall retention policy.
